# Mozilla Explainers

This document is a work in progress.

This repo is for the development of explainers from Mozilla contributors. 
Mozilla Explainers can start with as little as a sentence summarizing a user-relevant problem 
and how a new technology could help solve it.
The [W3C TAG Explainer](https://tag.w3.org/explainers/) provides a basic outline, examples, and tips for developing explainers.

In general we expect to focus on developing explainers that:
* solve a user-relevant problem as prioritized by the [Mozilla Web Vision](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/webvision/full/) (Web Vision)
* and propose a solution aligned with the Web Vision
* or a counterproposal that is more aligned with the Web Vision than existing technologies or proposals

## How to add an Explainer
1. write up a minimum viable (or more) draft explainer
2. get reviews and approvals from your senior standards person (ask [@tantek](https://github.com/tantek) for who) and the CTO office (ask [@martinthomson](https://github.com/martinthomson) for who)
3. convert your draft explainer to a name.md file and submit a PR to add the file to this repo
